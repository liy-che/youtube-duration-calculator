Do you have times when you have to watch a YouTube video under a time limit, whether a quick video before going out, before a class, or for productivity purposes? Just a quick video on a Pomodoro break?

Add the Duration Calculator to quickly get the time it takes to watch a YouTube video under different speed settings.

It also shows duration difference compared to the normal x1 speed.
 
You can conveniently set video speed within the calculator.

It can be used with a mouse or keyboard shortcuts:
Open: CMD+SHIFT+S (Mac)
           CTRL+SHIFT+S (Windows)
Change speed: Arrow keys. 
                           left, up - decrease speed
                           right, down - increase speed
Set speed: ENTER key
Set speed and close: Press ENTER twice
Close without setting speed: SPACE key
